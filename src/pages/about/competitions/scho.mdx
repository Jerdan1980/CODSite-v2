# CODSChO '20
---
We had 9 individuals competing in CODSChO (There were a group of people who signed up for accommodations, but ultimately were unable to take the exam.) The competition was held on **August 30th, 2020** as a mock examination of the IChO, for those who did not make the USA IChO team. This competition was first proposed by Alec "apc1234567" Zhu and was written by Alec Zhu and Anugrah "llamachemist" Chemeparathy. Kwanwoo "Fizzest" Park was involved in coordinating and proctoring the competition.
