# Introduction

In this module, we attempt to explain the area of physical chemistry known as **(chemical) kinetics**, which involves the concept of "how fast" a reaction occurs.
Do note that calculus is crucial for a field like kinetics, but we will still provide high-level math arnings when it does show up from time to time.

As of right now, the world of chemical kinetics has not matured to a point where they are built upon three simple laws (like calssical thermodynamics), or any set of unifying principles.
There are many different theories proposed in terms of how chemical kinetics functions, but each has their own pros and cons (kind of like real gases, like you saw earlier).

We will first look into chemical kinetics from a macroscopic perspective, in which we will learn about **reaction rates** and **rate laws**.
Then, we will attempt to make connections with these concepts with the microscopic worlds, in which we will introduce **elementary reactions** and **reaction mechanisms**.


# Rate Laws

## Reaction rates

In order to determine how fast an object is moving, we use **velocity**. Similarly, to determine how fast a reaction occurs, we use **reaction rate**.

To qualitatively determine how fast an object is movign, we must first determine the extent of how far an object traveled.
The easiest (if not only) metric to measure this concept is **displacement**, or the **difference** between the initial position and the final position.

Given the general reaction described by

$$
aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD
$$

An example of the **rate** of the **reaction** is expressed as below:

$$
\textrm{Rate of consumption of A} = -\frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}
$$


> **CMA #1:** In kinetics, all rates should be **positive** values.
As shown in the expression above, $\Delta[A]$ should be a negative value because the reactand is being _consumed_.
Therefore, a negative sign is added to make the overall expression a positive value.
_If you end up with a negative reaction rate, you have already failed as a chemist_


>**CMA #2:** It is crucial that you illustrate **both** the chemical equation and what species is being utilized to measure the rate of the reaciton, **especially** when reactants or products have different coefficients.

> Why?: Given a reaction $2A + B \rightarrow C$, two molecules of A and one molecule of B are consumed, so we expect the rate of consumption of A to be two times greater than the rate of consumption of B.

> As most people are lazy, **(unique) reaction rates** are utilized to avoid this annoyance.
The unique reaction rate can be calculated as shown below:

$$
v = \frac{1}{v_J} \frac{\Delta[J]}{\Delta t}
$$

> Where $v_J$ is the coefficient of the species, and $\Delta[J]$ is the change in concentration of the species.
Do note that you still need to report the chemical equation if it is not already present in your exam.

**Calculus Alert!**

Often, the _instantaneous_ reaction rate is much more valuable than the _average_ reaciton rate.
The _instantaneous_ reaction rate is the rate of the reaction at a certain instant, which can be calculated by taking the derivative of concentration wiht respect to time:

$$
\textrm{Rate of consumption of A} = -\frac{d[A]}{dt}
$$

In competitive chemistry, you'll often see the former in terms of algebriac expressions or differential equations, and you'll see the latter when the question wants you to calculate it.


## Rate Laws

For most, if not all of the reactions we are considering in this module, the **unique reaction rate** is related to the **concentrations** of the reactants and products present at a given instant.
This relationship is known as the **rate law**, and will be used extensively throughout your chemistry career.
A general expression for the rate law of reaction $A + B \rightarrow P$ is shown below.

$$
v = k_r [A]^n [B]^m
$$

Do not forget that they are **experimentally determined**; they cannot be derived from a chemical equation alone.
This becomes obviously clear with two very similar reactions yet totally different rate laws:

| Chemical Equation | Rate law |
| :-- | :-: |
| $H_2 (g) + Br_2 (g) \rightarrow HBr (g)$ | $v = \frac{k_a [H_2][Br_2]^{1/2}}{[Br_2] + k_b [HBr]}$ |
| $H_2 (g) + I_2 (g) \rightarrow 2 HI (g)$ | $v = k_r [H_2][I_2]$ |

The value $k_r$ is known as the **rate constant**, which is dependent on **temperature**.
The units of the rate constant will depend on the **order** of the reaction, but it will **always** ensure the units of the unique is concentration over time.

Which is dependent on the values $n$ and $m$. if $n$ is equal to 1, the general reaction $A+B\rightarrow P$ is **first order** with respect to A, if $m$ is equal to 2, it is **second order** with reaction to B, and if both $n$ = 1 and $m$ = 2, the **overall order** of the reaction is **third order**.
The values of $n$ and $m$ **do not** have to be integers.
They can be fractions, negativel values, or even zero.

> **Tip #1:** Throughout competitive chemistry, checking units can give you a lot of help in terms of determining the overall order of the reaction, or checking errors.
Make sure the unique reaction rate always ends with concentration over time!

Rate laws are an extremely powerful tool, and most problems related to kinetics will involve rate laws.
If you know the rate law, you can predict the reaction rate at any composition and any time.


## Determining Rate Laws

There are two **very** common ways that rate lawas are determined.
The first method is one that you may have already mastered in your general chemistry course, and is known as the **method of initial rates**.

The **method of initial rates** takes the reaciton rate at the beginning of the reaciton at different initial concentrations of reactants.
When determining the rate order, **all except one** of the species' concentration is held constant, and one is varied.

Because the differential $\frac{d[A]}{dt}$ cannot be determined, the average reaction rate at the very beginning of the reaction is taken.
(_In easier words, the average reaction rate from_ t = 0 _to_ t = A number close to zero. _The smaller the $\Delta t$, the more accurate_)

$$
\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t} = \frac{d[A]}{dt}
$$

The rates of reaction for two sets of initial conditions (where, [A] is held constant and [B] is varied) for a general reaction:

$$
aA+bB\rightarrow cC+dD
$$

are given by:

$$
v_1 = k_r [A]^n_0 [B]^m_1 \\
v_2 = k_r [A]^n_0 [B]^m_2
$$

If $v_1$ is divided by $v_2$, and the logarithm is taken of both sides, and then it is solved for $m$, we obtain:

$$
m = \frac{\ln\frac{v_1}{v_2}}{\ln\frac{[B]_1}{[B]_2}}
$$

The order of [A] can also be determined in a similar way.

> **CMA #3:** Data of **initial rates** are far more valuable than rates at any other instance as they ignore the prescense of products, which can affect the overall rate of the reaction.
Make sure the data you are using are indeed **initial rates**.

The second method is known as the **method of isolation**.
This involves having some of the species to be in a large excess in comparison to the others.

Using the general reaciton above, for example if [A] >> [B], then we could assume that [A] stays relatively constant throughout the reaciton.
Therefore, if the true rate law is:

$$
v = k_r [A]^n [B]^m
$$

We could approximate that:

$$
v = k'_r [B]^m
$$

Where $k'_r = k_r [A]^n$.
The order of [B] can also be determined in a similar way (by holding [B] in a large excess in comparison to [A]).

In competitive chemistry, you will sommetimes always come across one or the other, but you may also have to utilize both.
Check **Challenge Problem 1** for an example.


## Integrated Rate Laws

**Calculus Alert!**

Integrated Rate laws are found by taking the integral of the rate law.
Given the general reaction:

$$
A+B\rightarrow P
$$

Just as a reminder, the chemical equation is **independent** of rate law.


### First-order to A

$$
v = -\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]
$$

Taking the integral of this equation gives:

$$
\ln\frac{[A]}{[A]_0} = -kt
\textrm{ or }
[A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}
\textrm{ or }
\ln[A] = \ln[A]_0 - kt
$$

The first-order reaction undergoes **exponential decay**.
The larger the rate constant, the faster the species decays.

The first-order integrated rate law has a **constant** half-life independent of the concentration of reactants.
This is **only true** for first-order reactions.

$$
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}
$$

The plot of $\ln[A]$ vs. $t$ is **linear** for first-order reactions.


### Second-order to A

$$
v = -\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^2
$$

Taking the integral of this equation gives:

$$
\frac{1}{[A]} = \frac{1}{[A]_0} + kt
$$

The half-life of second-order reaction is:

$$
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k[A]}
$$

The plot of 1/[A] vs. $t$ is **linear** for second-order reactions.
Decay of second-order reactions tend to be much slower in comparison to first-order reactions.
Many pollutants tend to be second-order.


### Zeroth-order to A

For zeroth-order reactions, the rate of the reaction is **constant** independent of the concentration of the reactant.

$$
v = -\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k
$$

Taking the integral of this reaction gives:

$$
[A] = [A]_0 + kt
$$

The plot of [A] vs. $t$ is **linear** for zeroth-order reactions.

### Integrated Rate Laws
| Order | Reaction Type | Rate Law | Integrated Rate Law | Half-life |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | $A\rightarrow P$ | $v = k_r$ | $[A]_t = [A]_0 + kt$ | |
| 1 | $A\rightarrow P$ | $v = k_r [A]$ | $\ln[A]_t = \ln[A]_0 - kt$ | $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k}$ |
| 2 | $A\rightarrow P$ | $v = k_r [A]^2$ | $\frac{1}{[A]_t} = \frac{1}{[A]_0} + kt$ | $t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln 2}{k[A]}$ |
