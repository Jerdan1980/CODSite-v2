# Introduction

In this module, we will look into chemical kinetics from as microscopic perspective, in which we will learn about the **Arrhenius equation**, **elementary reactions**, and **reaction mechanisms**.
We will make a lot of connections with the macrosckopic properties introduced in **Kinetics I**, so please make sure to read that guide before reading this one.


# Rate Contants and temperature

Rate constants of all reactions depends heavily on temperature, albeit slightly differently.
Most reactions are said to show **Arrhenius behavior**, in which the rate increases exponentially with the reciprocal of temperature.
However, not all reactions illustrate this behavior.
Some reactions, such as explosives or enzyme-controlled reactions, may show different behavior.

Arrhenius behavior can be approximated by the empirical formula shown below:

$$
\frac{d\ln k_r}{dT} = \frac{E_a}{RT^2}
$$

Where $E_a$ is known as the **activation energy**, or the minimum amount of energy required for the chemical reaction to proceed.
A higher activation energy results in a slower overall reaction.
A detailed explanation of activation energy will be covered in **Kinetics IV**.
Integrating the above expression (assuming that activation energy is independent of temperature) gives the important expression:

$$
\ln k_r = \ln A - \frac{E_a}{RT}
\textrm{ or }
k_r = Ae^{-E_a / RT}
$$

The above is known as the **Arrhenius equation**.
The constant $A$ is known as the **pre-exponential factor** that is experimentally determined.
Further detailed discussion will be, again, illustrated in **Kinetics IV**.

There are important things to take away from the **Arrhenius equation**, while you won't use this form of the equation very often.

First, the **greater** the activation energy, the **stronger** the temperature dependent of the rate constant is.
For reactions that involve very low activation energy (or perhaps, even **negative** activation energies), you could approximate that the rate constant is relatively unaffected by temperature (example: photolysis, radical reactions).
For reactions that involve rather high activation energies, this is not possible.

Second, the Arrhenius equation allows the derivation of a much more useful equation:

$$
\ln\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \frac{E_a}{R} (\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2})
$$

This allows the comparison of two rate constants at different temperatures.
As long as you know the activation energy and one of the rate constants at a certain temperature, you can calculate the rate constant for any temperature at a reasonable range.

# Elementary reactions

Elementary reactions look very similar to normal chemical reactions, but they have a critical difference.
Elementary reactions are reactions that occur on the **microscopic** scale between **molecules**.
Therefore, elementary reactions may look **very** different from the **macroscopic** chemical reactions that you see, but the initial **reactants** and final **products** must match up.

$$
\textrm{reactants} \rightarrow \textrm{intermediates} \rightarrow {products}
$$

**Intermediates** are **not** present in the chemical equation, and **cannot** be generally observed.
**Reaction mechanisms** illustrate the steps in which reactants become intermediates, and how intermediates become products.

An example of a **reaction mechanism** is shown below.

$$
2 NO(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2 NO_2(g) \\
\textbf{Step 1: } NO + NO \rightarrow N_2O_2 \\
\textbf{Step 2: } O_2 + N_2O_2 \rightarrow NO_2 + NO_2
$$

Reaction mechanisms **cannot** be determined experimentally (they are proposed), but they can be used to support the experimentally determined rate law.
When proposing a mechanism, you must keep three things in mind:

1. The elementary steps must add up to the overall balanced chemical equation.
2. The elementary steps must be reasonable.
3. The mechanism must correlate with the ovserved experimental rate law.

Note that different mechanisms can point to the same rate law:

$$
2 NO(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2 NO_2(g) \\
\textbf{Step 1: } NO + O_2 \rightarrow NO_3 \\
\textbf{Step 2: } NO_3 + NO \rightarrow NO_2 + NO_2
$$

_Unlike_ chemical equations, its rate law **can** be written from elemtary reactions.

The Rate Laws of Elementary Reactions
| Molecularity | Reaction type | Rate law |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | $A \rightarrow P$ | $v = k_r [A]$ |
| 2 | $A + A \rightarrow P$ | $v = k_r [A]^2$ |
| 2 | $A + B \rightarrow P$ | $v = k_r [A] [B]$ |
| 3 (unlikely) | $A + B + C \rightarrow P$ | $v = k_r [A] [B] [C]$ |


## Reaction Mechanisms

Potential energy graphs are important for chemical kinetics.
The graph below is an example of a potential energy graph for the above mechanism:



$$
2 NO(g) + O_2(g) \rightarrow 2 NO_2(g) \\
\textbf{Step 1: } NO + O_2 \rightarrow NO_3 \\
\textbf{Step 2: } NO_3 + NO \rightarrow NO_2 + NO_2
$$

The highest point of the potential energy graph (elementary reaction with the highest activation energy) is the **rate-determining step (RDS)**, which will determine the rate of the overall reaction.
Do note that, if there are multiple mechanisms that can lead the same reactants into products, the mechanism with the smallest rate-determining step is preferred (this is known as side-stepping).

The first step is the "fast" step with the rate law

$$
v = k_1 [NO] [O_2]
$$

But is not included in the overall rate law.
The second step is the "slow" step with the highest activation energy with the rate law

$$
v = k_2 [NO_3] [NO]
$$

And is equal to the rate of the overall reaction.
Do note that, **intermediates** should **not** be in the overall rate law.
Later on, in **Kinetics III**, you will learn how to remove these intermediates from the rate law.
