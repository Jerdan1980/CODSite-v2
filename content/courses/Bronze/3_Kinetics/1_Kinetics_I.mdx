# Introduction

In this module, we attempt to explain the area of physical chemistry known as **(chemical) kinetics**, which involves the concept of "how fast" a reaction occurs.
Do note that calculus is crucial for a field like kinetics, but we will still provide high-level math warnings when it does show up from time to time.

As of right now, the world of chemical kinetics has not matured to a point where it is built upon simple laws (like classical thermodynamics), or any set of unifying principles.
There are many different theories proposed in terms of how chemical kinetics functions, but each has their own pros and cons (kind of like real gases, like you saw earlier).

We will first look into chemical kinetics from a macroscopic perspective, in which we will learn about **reaction rates** and **rate laws**.
Then, we will attempt to make connections with these concepts and the microscopic worlds, in which we will introduce **elementary reactions** and **reaction mechanisms**.


# Rate Laws

## Reaction rates

In order to determine how fast an object is moving, we use **velocity**. Similarly, to determine how fast a reaction occurs, we use **reaction rate**.

To qualitatively determine how fast an object is moving, we must first determine how far an object traveled.
The easiest (if not only) metric to measure this concept is **displacement**, or the **difference** between the initial position and the final position. We then divide this displacement by the time it took to travel the distance to get the velocity. Likewise, the reaction rate of a given species is the difference between the initial concentration and the final concentration divided by the time.

Given the general reaction described by

$$
aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD
$$

An example of the **rate** of the **reaction** is expressed below:

$$
\textrm{Rate of consumption of A} = -\frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}
$$


> **CMA #1:** In kinetics, all rates should be **positive** values.
As shown in the expression above, $\Delta[A]$ should be a negative value because the reactand is being _consumed_.
Therefore, a negative sign is added to make the overall expression a positive value.
_If you end up with a negative reaction rate, you have already failed as a chemist._


>**CMA #2:** It is crucial that you illustrate **both** the chemical equation and what species is being utilized to measure the rate of the reaction, **especially** when reactants or products have different coefficients.

> Why? Given a reaction $2A + B \rightarrow C$, two molecules of A and one molecule of B are consumed, so we expect the rate of consumption of A to be two times greater than the rate of consumption of B.

> As most people are lazy, **(unique) reaction rates** are utilized to avoid this annoyance.
The unique reaction rate can be calculated as shown below:

$$
v = \frac{1}{v_J} \frac{\Delta[J]}{\Delta t}
$$

> Where $v_J$ is the coefficient of the species, and $\Delta[J]$ is the change in concentration of the species.
Do note that you still need to report the chemical equation if it is not already present in your exam.

**Calculus Alert!**

Often, the _instantaneous_ reaction rate is much more valuable than the _average_ reaction rate.
The _instantaneous_ reaction rate is the rate of the reaction at a certain instant, which can be calculated by taking the derivative of concentration with respect to time:

$$
\textrm{Rate of consumption of A} = -\frac{d[A]}{dt}
$$

In competitive chemistry, you'll often see the former in terms of algebraic expressions or differential equations, and you'll see the latter when the question wants you to calculate it.


## Rate Laws

For most, if not all of the reactions we are considering in this module, the **unique reaction rate** is related to the **concentrations** of the reactants and products present at a given instant.
This relationship is known as the **rate law**, and will be used extensively throughout your chemistry career.
A general expression for the rate law of reaction $A + B \rightarrow P$ is shown below.

$$
v = k_r [A]^n [B]^m
$$

Do not forget that coefficients m and n are **experimentally determined**; they cannot be derived from a chemical equation alone.
This becomes obviously clear with two very similar reactions yet totally different rate laws:

| Chemical Equation | Rate law |
| :-- | :-: |
| $H_2 (g) + Br_2 (g) \rightarrow 2 HBr (g)$ | $v = \frac{k_a [H_2][Br_2]^{1/2}}{[Br_2] + k_b [HBr]}$ |
| $H_2 (g) + I_2 (g) \rightarrow 2 HI (g)$ | $v = k_r [H_2][I_2]$ |

The value $k_r$ is known as the **rate constant**, which is dependent on **temperature**.
The units of the rate constant will depend on the **order** of the reaction, but it will **ensure the units of the reaction rate is concentration over time.**
