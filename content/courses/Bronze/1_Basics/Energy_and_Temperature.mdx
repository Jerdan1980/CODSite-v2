# Introduction

Energy and Temperature are two fundemental concepts for physical chemistry that all competitors should have an excellent understanding of.
It is the foundation of physical chemistry as a whole, and as we cover more and more topics, its significance will be made clear.


## Temperature

**Thermodynamic Temperature (_T_)** is a property that determines which direction **energy** will flow towards between two thermally conductive objects in contact.
The sample with higher temperature will low energy as a form of **heat** to the sample with lower temperature, until the two samples reach **thermal equilibirum**, in which the two samples reach the same temperature.


## Energy

**Energy (_E_)** is the **capacity to do work**.
In order for a reaction to occur, which indeed requires work, it requires **energy**.
More energy would mean more ability to do work.
In physics, we define **work** as the motion against an opposion force.
The units used with energy is the **Joule (_J_)**.

Two types of energy are extremely relevant in chemistry.
**Kinetic energy** illustrates how much energy the object opssesses due to its motion.
The faster an object is moving, the more kinetic energy it has.
Try throwing a bullet in comparison to shooting it; the difference is enormous.

Similarly, because it is much harder to throw something heavy at a fast velocity in comparison to something light, assuming both objects are traveling at the same speed, the heavier object has a greater kinetic energy in comparison to the lighter object.

$$
E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
$$

**Potential energy (_V_)** illustrates how much energy the object possesses due to its position.
Position in this context can mean a lot of things.
Because potential energy depends on the **type of force** taht the object experiences, ther eis no "universal" equation.

The most common type of potential energy in physics is known as the **gravitational potential energy**, the potential energy that results from the force of gravity.

$$
V(h) = mgh
$$

The most common type of potential energy in chemistry is known as teh **Columb potential energy**, the potential energy that resutls fromt he force of the electrostatic interaction between two electric charges.

$$
V(r) = k \frac{Q_1 Q_2}{r_{12}}
$$

Where $r_{12}$ is the distance between the two electric charges, and $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the charges.

If $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ possess the same signs, **repulsion** will occur, resulting in an overall **positive** potential energy.

If $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ possess the opposite signs, **attraction** will occur, resulting an an overall **negative** potential energy.

When the distance between the two charges, $r_{12}$, becomes infinitely long, we can say that the Coulomb potential energy becomes zero, regardless of the charges themselves.

The **total energy** of a system is the sum of its **kinetic** and **potential** energies.

$$
E = E_k + E_p
$$

Although energy can be transferred and transformed from one form into another, it cannot be created nor destroyed.
**The total energy is constant.**
This is known as the **low of conservation of energy**.


## Internal Energy

While kinetic and potential energy can be considered from a **macroscopic view**, considering bulk matter as a whole, it is more common to consider it from a **microscopic view**.
The **sum of all** of the molecules' potential and kinetic energy is known as **internal energy**.

Here's an example by Dr. Rave: A glass of water at room temperature sitting on a table may seem to be at rest, with no apparent kinetic or potential energy.
However, on the microscopic scale, there are an unfathomable amount of water molecules moving with great speeds, and a lot of intermolecular forces between the water molecules keeping them as a liquid.

We will go into further detail in the **Thermodynamics** unit.
