# Introduction

In the previous module, we've introduced the concept of **bulk matter**.
We will be extensively covering one of the three common states of bulk matter, known as **gases**.
One of the macroscopic properties that results from the chaotic movement of molecules is known as **pressure**.

In this module, we will learn how **pressure**, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas molecules are all dependent on each other. The **ideal gas law** describes these relations in one compact equation.


# Ideal Gas Law

Experimentally, gases are found to exert a specific pressure at a certain amount of molecules (n), volume (V), and temperature (T).
A fancy way of saying this is that gas substances generally obey an **equation of state**.

$$
p = f(n, V, T)
$$

Nobody really cares about the equation above, but the same ignorance cannot be shared with the equation below.
The **ideal gas law**, formally known as the **perfect gas equation of state**, puts the findings above into a usable equation:

$$
pV = nRT
$$

The $R$ is known as the **molar gas constant** and is equal to $8.314\textrm{ J K}^{-1}\textrm{ mol}^{-1}$.
Note that the name is rather misleading, as this constant of proportionality is found in other equations that do not necessarily involve the gas phase, such as the Nernst equation (albeit in slightly different units).

> **CMA #1:** **Always** check your units when using the **molar gas constant**.
The units tend to be $\frac{\textrm{L}\cdot\textrm{pressure}}{\textrm{K}\cdot\textrm{mol}}$, with $\textrm{pressure}$ being units of pressure.

> There is something important to notice, especially for those who lack a physics background:
you may be deceived into thinking that $R = 8.314\textrm{ J K}^{-1}\textrm{ mol}^{-1}$ and the more commonly used $R = 0.08206\textrm{ L atm K}^{-1}\textrm{ mol}^{-1}$ are two different constants due to their seemingly different units, but they are in fact, **the same constant**.

> Because the former uses **SI units**, the units of pressure are in pascals, which is equivalent to $\textrm{kg m}^{-1}\textrm{ s}^{-2}$ in SI base units.
After converting liters into $\textrm{m}^3$, ($1\textrm{ J}=1\textrm{ kg m}^2\textrm{ s}^{-2}$), it should be clear that these two are clearly the same constant.
Always make sure that you are using the gas constant with the appropriate units of pressure, and if necessary, convert them into values that seem fit for your purpose.

> **CMA #2:** Never, ever, use Celsius as a unit of temperature in calculations in competitive chemistry.
Celsius can often be the source of silly mistakes, especially for beginners.
As it only takes two or three seconds to convert Celsius into Kelvin, it is worth doing so to prevent getting easy questions wrong for dumb reasons and is a good habit to get into.

There are other equations with trivial names that come up when learning gas laws.
In most cases, you can use the **ideal gas law** rather than the equations below, and you do not need to memorize the names.
We have listed them below to emphasize the relationships between variables.

- **Boyle's Law:** $p_1 V_1 = p_2 V_2$
- **Charles' Law:** $\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}$
- **Gay-Lussac's Law:** $\frac{p_1}{T_1} = \frac{p_2}{T_2}$
- **Avogadro's principle:** $V = n V_m$

You should be able to derive all four of these equations from the ideal gas law.
When doing calculations comparing two states as shown below:

$$
\frac{p_1 V_1}{n_1 T_1} = \frac{p_2 V_2}{n_2 T_2}
$$

Don't forget to cancel out any variables that stay constant between the two states.


## Applications of the Ideal Gas Law

There are a **lot** of applications for the ideal gas law and it will be abused extensively throughout derivations and even the hardest chemistry problems.
We will illustrate three fairly common applications of the ideal gas law.

First, we would like to introduce two very common conditions:

- **Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP):** $T = 25\degree\textrm{C} (298.15\textrm{ K})$, $p = 1\textrm{ bar}$
  - The **molar volume**, or the volume that 1 mole of ideal gas fills up with the above conditions, is $24.79\textrm{ L}\cdot\textrm{mol}^{-1}$
- **Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP):** $T = 0\degree\textrm{C} (273.15\textrm{ K})$, $p = 1\textrm{ atm}$
  - The **molar volume** is $22.41\textrm{ L}\cdot\textrm{mol}^{-1}$

Let's take a look at the three common applications of the ideal gas law.

The first application is the calculation of **molar volume:**

$$
V_m = \frac{V}{n} = \frac{nRT/p}{n} = \frac{RT}{p}
$$

The second application is the calculation of the **density** of an ideal **gas:**

$$
d = \frac{m}{V} = \frac{nM_r}{nV_m} = \frac{M_r}{V_m} = \frac{M_r p}{RT}
$$

The third application is the calculation of **molar concentration** of an ideal **gas:**

$$
c = \frac{n}{V} = \frac{pV/RT}{V} = \frac{p}{RT} = \frac{1}{V_m}
$$

All three of these applications are used fairly commonly throughout competitive chemistry.


## Mixture of Gases

When different gases are inserted into one container, as long as they do not react, you **can** treat the different gases as a **single** ideal gas.
**Dalton's Law of partial pressures** states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of its components:

$$
p_{tot} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i
$$

The **ideal gas law** can be inserted to prove an alternate definition:

$$
p_{tot} = \frac{n_{tot} RT}{V}
$$

There is a convenient way to express how much of a certain species is contained in a mixture of gases.
The **mole fraction** $(\chi)$ illustrates the fraction a component contributes to the total amount of molecules in a mixture:

$$
\chi_A = \frac{n_A}{n_{tot}}
$$

The sum of all mole fractions must **always** equal 1, or 100%.
With this new quantity, Dalton's law of partial pressures can be redefined using mole fractions:

$$
p_A + p_B = \chi_A p_{tot} + \chi_B p_{tot} = (\chi_A + \chi_B) p_{tot} = p_{tot}
$$
