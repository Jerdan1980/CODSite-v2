# Introduction

In the previous module, we've introduced the concept of **bulk matter**.
We will be extensively covering one of the three common states of bulk matter, known as **gases**.
One of the macroscopic properties that results from the chaotic movement of mulecules is known as **pressure**.

In this module, we will learn how **pressure**, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas molecules are all dependent on each other and the **ideal gas law**


# Ideal Gas Law

It is experimentally determined that given a certian amount (of gas molecules), volume, and temperatuer, then the bulk matter is found to exert a specific pressure.
A fancy way of saying this is that gas substances generally obey an **equation of state**.

$$
p = f(n, V, T)
$$

Nobody really cares about the equation above, but the same ignorance cannot be shared with the equation below.
The **ideal gas law**, formally known as the **perfect gas equation of state**, puts the findings above into a useable equation:

$$
pV = nRT
$$

The $R$ is known as the **molar gas constant** and is equal to $8.312\textrm{ J K}^{-1}\textrm{ mol}^{-1}$.
Note that the name is rather misleading as this constant of proportionality is found in other equations that do not involve the gas phase, such as the Nernst equation (alveit in slightly different units).

> **CMA #1:** In addition to the misleading name, **always** check your units when using the **molar gas constant**.
THe units tend to be $\frac{\textrm{L}\cdot\textrm{pressure}}{\textrm{K}\cdot\textrm{mol}}$, with $\textrm{pressure}$ being units of pressure.

> But there is something important to notice, especially for those who lack a physics background:
you may be decieved into thinking that $R = 8.312\textrm{ J K}^{-1}\textrm{ mol}^{-1}$ and the more commonly used $R = 0.008206\textrm{ L atm K}^{-1}\textrm{ mol}^{-1}$ are two differnet constants due to their seemingly different units, but they are in fact, **the same constant**.

> Becuase the former uses **SI units**, the units of pressure are in pascals, which is equivalent to
