# Introduction

In this module, we will learn about the properties of the **gas phase**.
Before we get into the Gas Laws and Kinetic Molecular Theory (KMT), we will dedicate a full page on **bulk matter** and **pressure**, two macroscopic properties of gases that will be crucial for your understanding of state of matter.

This module won't be specifically about gases, but will provide a fundemental basis for the topics related to states of matter (that being, solids, liquids, and gases).


# Macroscopic vs. Molecular

**Macroscopic** properties are things that appear ont he surface.
**Chemical reactions**, such as the combustion of hydrogen, are **macroscopic** properties.
They follow **Newtonian mechanics** (Classical mechanics) and most, if not all, substances that we commonly see are composed of **bulk matter*, forms of matter that consist of large numbers of molecules.
We'll talk about bulk matter in the next section.

**Molecular** properties are things that occur on the molecular level.
Using the previous example, most chemical reactions don't occur by simple "collision" of the reactants which automatically turns into products.
In fact, even the most basic reactions undergo a series of specific collisions between molecules, known as **reaction mechanisms**, to create products, which occurs a substantial number of times (You will learn about this in **Kinetics I**, which is the next section of the guide).
The properties of macroscopic properties emerge from the collective behavior of vast numbers of molecules.
Molecular properties follow **quantum mechanics**.

# Bulk matter

**Bulk matter** is commonly found in three states in competitive chemistry: solids, liquids, and gases.
While these three may seem vastly different, you may recall from common knowledge that ice melts into water when you increase its temperature above $0\degree\textrm{C}$, and water turns into water vapor above $100\degree\textrm{C}$.

It is reasonable to make the connection that the pase of the matter is **dependent** on temperature.
As we learned in the **Energy and Temperature** module, as temperature increases, the internal energy of the system **also** increases.
As it turns out, what phase the bulk matter obtains is dependent on **intermolecular forces**, and how much **internal energy** the bulk matter has a t a certain temperature to overcome these intermolecular forces.

When the **internal energy** (sum of microscopic potentital and kinetic energy) of molecules are great enough to overcome most, if not all, intermolecular forces (which **lowers** the internal potentital eneryg of molecules), the bulk matter is known as a **gas**, or **vapor**.

> **CMA #1:** While we often use these two terms indistinguishably, formally there is a distinction.
Bulk matter is a gas when, at any pressure, it does not condense into a liquid. (carbon dioxide is formally a gas above 304 K)

> Vapor is when, at some pressure, it can condense into a liquid. (water "vapor" is formally a vapor below 670 K)


# Properties of Gases

Because gases have little to no intermolecular forces between them, the distince between gas molecules tend to be great in size.
This makes them **compressible**, allowing gas molecules to be confined into a smaller volume.

The kinetic energy of gas molecules tends to be much greater than liquid or solid molecules.
Therefore, the motion of gas molecules is described to be **chaotic**, or moving in random motion.
This is an important observation; because there is a vast number of molecules in the gas phase, it allows the chaotic movements of molecules to average each out into something predictable (macroscopic properties such as pressure).

We will take a look at one of the most fundemental qualities used throughout fluid mechanics and gas laws which results from this collective chaotic motion, known as **pressure**.


## Pressure

When molecules collide onto a surface, they exert a **force**, which is dependent on the **acceleration** in which the molecule is travelling at.
Because we cannot measure the force each molecule applies to a specific location of the surface, we instead take the average of the forces within a certain area and use teh quantity known as **pressure**.
If more molecules collide at a given instance (leading to an overall greater force), the pressure of the environment increases.
The formula for pressure is given below:

$$
P = \frac{F}{A}
$$

It is rare to use this equation in competitive chemistry, but the following equation (which is derived from the above) is used throughout chemistry.
You can measure the atmospheric pressure using a **barometer** or **manometer** with the following equation:

$$
P = \rho hg
$$

where $\rho$ is density, $h$ is height, and $g$ is the acceleration of free fall.
For more information about how to utilize **barometers** or **manometers**, please refer to a general chemistry textbook.

There are many different kinds of pressure used throughout competitive chemistry.
There is no "most common" unit, as all of them are commonly used.
It is a crucial skill for you to be able to do unit conversions sqiftly and accurately.
Please memorize these numbers as some local competitions do not provide these values.

- **Pascal** (Pa): Pascal is the official SI unit of pressure

- **Bar** (bar): Very commonly used, 1 bar is known as the **standard** pressure. This might not seem important now, but it will come up later in the **Thermodynamics** unit.

  - $1 \textrm{ bar} = 100 \textrm{ kPa}$

- **Atmospheric pressure** (atm): Also very common, is the traditional unit which is the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at sea level.
The value of 1 bar and 1 atm is very close, so you can approximate one for the other if you're feeling lazy.
But for precise calculations, the distinction should be made.

  - $1 \textrm{ atm} = 1.01325 \times 10^5 \textrm{ Pa}$

- **Torr** and **Millimeters of mercury** (torr, mmHg): both are interchangeable and are practically indistinguishable.
Made mainly for barometers which use mercury.

  - $1 \textrm{ atm} = 760 \textrm{ torr} = 760 \textrm{ mmHg}$
