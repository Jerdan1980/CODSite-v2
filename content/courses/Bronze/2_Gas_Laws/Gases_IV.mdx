# Introduction

This module will cover all of the other concepts that are frequently taught in a regular chemistry course.
While a lot of these concepts don't make an explicit appearance in competitive chemistry, it is important that you know them very well.


# Effusion and Diffusion

**Effusion** is the escape of gas molecuels through a small pinhole into a vacuum or a region of lower pressure.
A common example of effusion is air escaping from a bicycle tire valve.

**Diffusion** is the gradual dispersal of one substance through another substance.
A common example of diffusion is a bottle of vinegar gradually dispersing its pungent smell when it is opened.

**Graham's law** is frequently used for **both** effusion and diffusion:

$$
\frac{(\textrm{Rate of effusion of A molecules})}{(\textrm{Rate of effusion of B moleucles})} = \sqrt{\frac{M_B}{M_A}} = \frac{t_B}{t_A}
$$

It emphasizes that at a constnat temperature, the rate of effusion (or diffusion) is proportional to the reciprocal square root of molar mass, a relationship that was illustrated by the kinetic molecular theory (KMT) in the previous module.

While problems involving Graham's law in competitive chemistry is uncommon, sometimes, the "time it took" for gases to effuse is given instead of the rate itself.


# Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

The **Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution** illustrates the distribution of the speeds of gas particles at a certain temperature.
This was also derived from the **KMT** (the derivation is way beyond the scope of this module, including the author himself) and the equation looks something like this:

$$
f(v) = 4\pi (\frac{M_r}{2\pi RT})^{3/2} v^2 e^{-Mv^2 / 2RT}
$$

You are not expected to know this formula, as it is hard to utilize.
However, you should be able to interpret graphs and its meaning.
As we learned from the KMT, the average speed of gas molecuels is dependent on **temperature** and **molar mass:**

$$
v_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_r}}
$$

This is illustrated by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions shown for different molar masses and for different temperatures:

As shown by the left graph, **lighter molecules** such as helium and neon have **high average speeds** but also **wider intervals**, meaning that hte speed of gas molecules can vry heavily.
As shown by the right graph, **higher temperatures** result in **higher average molecular speeds** but also **wider intervals**, a very similar result.


# Real Gases

The ideal gas law is a **limiting law**; it is increasingly valid as the pressure of the gas decreases, an observation pointed out in the previuos module (KMT).

Becuase of these approximations, the ideal gas law falls short in terms of accuracy when it comes to non-idal conditions, and therefore, more complex models are theorized to account for those situations.

**Real gases** are gases in the real world that deviate from the ideal gas model, either due to high pressure or the effects of **intermolecular forces**.
Its derivation from the ideal gas law is illustrated by the **compression factor**, z:

$$
z = \frac{pV}{nRT}
$$

The compression factor of an ideal gas, which has no intermolecular forces, is equal to 1.

if $z > 1$, **repulsive forces dominate** and tends to drive the molecuels apart.
We expect this to occur at **high pressures**, where the average distance between molecules is small, leading to much more repulsions between gas molecules being significant.

If $z < 1$, **attractive forces dominate** and tends to draw the molecules together.
We expect this to occur with molecuels that have **strong** intermolecular forces, such as water or ammonia.

To take into consideration these two factors, the **van der Waals equation** is commonly used:

$$
(P + \frac{an^2}{V^2}) (V - nb) = nRT
$$

The **van der Waal parameters**, $a$ and $b$, are temperature independent and unique to each gas.
These are "fixes" for the problems that the ideal gas law suffers from.

The $a$ coefficient represents **attractions** and takes into consideration of the intermolecular forces between gas molecules.
A larger $a$ coefficient represents greater attractions.

The $b$ coefficient represents **repulsions** and takes into consideration of the volume of molecules.
A larger $b$ coefficient represents larger molecules.

Bother of these variables will be provided to you in most of the questions.
The equation is worth knowing, but in most cases, will be provided in the question if requried.
