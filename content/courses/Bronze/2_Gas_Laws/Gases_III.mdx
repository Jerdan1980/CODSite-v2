# Introduction

**Scientific models** are created to explain or predict a certain feature of the world.
Although models commonly make many assumptions and approximations to make them easier to understand, the outcome of models are still extremely important.

In this module, we will cover one of the most basic models used throughout chemistry and physics, known as the **kinetic model of gases**.
While the derivation of equations from the model is beyond the scope of these notes, we will point out important facts and observations that come from them.
If you have a physics background, we recommend you check out the resources for this module and read about the derivation.

In **Gases IV**, we will cover all of the applications of kinetic molecular theory, and how they may be important in competitive chemistry.

# Kinetic Molecular Theory

The kinetic model of gases, also known as the **kinetic molecular theory**, relies on four fundamental assumptions.
We will first go over what each of the following assumptions means in real-life context, and where they fall short.

1. Gas molecules are assumed to be very small point particles.
2. The macroscopic limit is achieved.
3. The gas molecules are in ceaseless random motion, and collide among themselves and the container.
4. Molecules do not influence one another except during elastic collisions.

The first assumption, **Gas molecules are assumed to be very small point particles**, makes sense when we take into the consideration the fact that the distance between gas molecules tends to be very large.
In other words, the total volume of all the gas molecules is much less than the volume of the container.

This approximation becomes increasingly valid as the pressure of the gas decreases.
At high pressure, the ideal gas law is inadequate becuase it does not take into consideration the volume.

The second assumption states that **the macroscopic limit is achieved**.
As long as the quantity of gas molecules within a container is sufficiently large enough, where density of the gas is homogenous, this approximation is accurate.
If this approximation is not met, macroscopic properties such as pressure or temperature cannot be utilized, and the fluctuation of speeds do not average out (a statistical measure cannot be utilized).

The third assumption, in which **the gas molecules are in ceaseless random motion, and collide among themselves and the container**, assumes that all collisions are **perfectly elastic**.
This means the **kinetic energy** of gas molecules remains constant; they are not lost into other forms of energy, such as heat, noise, or potential energy.

The last assumption, **molecules do not influence one another except during elastic collisions**, is an important assumption.
It ignores any potential energy that gas molecules may have (meaning no intermolecular forces).
This may seem like a fatal flaw in the kinetic molecular theory, and, while it certianly is, it is not as bad as you may expect.
Even gases that are polar are predicted well as long as the pressure of the gas is low, because **rotating polar molecules** have a **much weaker** intermolecular force in comparison to regular dipole-dipole forces.

Using these four assumptions, the equation below can be derived:

$$
pV = \frac{1}{3} nM_r v^2_{\textrm{rms}}
$$

The $v_{\textrm{rms}}$ is known as the **root-mean-square speed**.
Because of the way this equation is derived, the _mean speed_ is not used.
However, the two values are relatively similar in value:

$$
v_{\textrm{mean}} = (\frac{8}{3\pi}^{1/2}) v_{\textrm{rms}}
$$

Back to the important equation.
Subsituting $pV$ for $nRT$ (ideal gas law) and rearrangement gives us the following equation:

$$
E_{k,avg} = \frac{3}{2} RT
$$

While this result may seem trivial at first, the outcome is tremendous; it illustrates that the average kinetic energy of gas molecules, and therefore the average speed of the molecules, is proportional to **temperature**.

The equation can also be rearranged into the following:

$$
v_{\textrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M_r}}
$$

This illustrates that theh average speed of molecules is **proprotional** to the reciprocal square root of molar mass.
This is confirmed experimentally by the **Graham's Law of Effusion**, about which we will learn in the next module.
