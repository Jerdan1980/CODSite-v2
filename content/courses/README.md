# Introduction
Welcome to anybody reading this!

Currently, we are in our *very* early stages of developing guides for CODSite v2.0, and any new modules will be put into here.

If you are unaware of our new proposed tier system, more information is provided [here](https://tinyurl.com/CODSCompGuide). 

Please contact fizzest#0001 for more information if you are interested in helping out on our guides. If you'd like to help us with developing the server, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8usR4B6) and direct message ModMail.
